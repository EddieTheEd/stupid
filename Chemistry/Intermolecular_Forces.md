title: Intermolecular Forces (IMF)
---

For my favourite student councillor <3

- Intermolecular means between molecules, NOT inside molecules (that's ***intra***molecular forces)
- Intermolecular forces are the types of (particularly attractive) forces that occur between molecules only
- All intermolecular forces are based on electrostatic forces of attractions and dipoles
- Types of Intermolecular Forces (IMF) include **dispersion forces**, **permanent dipole-dipole** and **hydrogen bonding** (this may seem confusing, but there's a reason it's called bonding, however, ***it is an intermolecular force***)

## Dispersion Forces (van der Waal's forces)

- Usually the weakest IMF of the three
- It is known as a ***temporary fluctuating dipole - induced dipole interaction***, interaction between a temporary fluctuating dipole and another dipole that it induces

- Explanation of Dispersion Forces
	- Electrons in molecules are not fixed, hence they move around the molecule freely
	- Hence, there is a chance that all electrons are on one side of the molecule as shown above in the first chlorine molecule, creating a dipole within the molecule itself due to one side of the molecule being electron-deficient and a concentration of electrons on the other side, hence making the molecule slightly polar
	- Dipole is not permanent - electrons keep moving around the molecule (hence it is **temporary** and **fluctuating**)
	- Because there is a concentration of electrons on the side of the $Cl_2$ molecule, it causes the electrons in the other molecule to be repelled, hence causing another **induced dipole**
	- Due to there being two molecules with dipoles, there is a **net force of attraction** between the negatively (temporarily) charged side of one molecule and the (induced) positive charged side (due to electrostatic forces of attraction between opposite charges)
- Dispersion forces are the **only universal IMF**, meaning it occurs between any type of molecule, regardless of their properties
- The higher the atomic numbers of the constituent atoms in the molecule, the greater the strength of the dispersion force
	- This is due to their being a larger amount of electrons in atoms with higher atomic numbers, hence the
