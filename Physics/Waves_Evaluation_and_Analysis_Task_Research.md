Yummy

Tis not quantifica but at least we're onto something that is less linear motion

This isn't actual task, just some research that I did
Libre Texts is unironically based and I love it

Bruh something happened and it all died except for this
Along with some of my Jekyll Lit notes :((
Oh well I'm sure no one needs this

## Huygen's Principle
- ### A little preamble before
	- Light is known to have strange properties, that of both of a particle and a wave (though it has discrepancies that also don't follow the properties of the two)
	- For now, we pretend that it's a wave and represent it like a ray; a line that begins at some point and has a certain direction
	- Sound is also kind of weird but at least it's something we can define simply as a vibration
