## Introduction

So uh... I guess it's almost common knowledge that I had a look at this during the holidays but Christian suggested an idea about writing everything you know in Physics. This obviously isn't everything, but it's a chunk of it, so here it is. I really think that it should be kinda more known earlier on for people studying Physics because when it actually is learned (in our course or other [university](../they.md) courses) sometimes people just don't understand it at all.

## The Standard Model

The Standard Model is simply a collation of elementary particles and fundamental forces (gravitational force, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force).
