title: Notes for Waves and Resonance
---
Waves are the main topic for both, but resonance is only for the experiment validation test, so they'll be in that order. Both are to be completed within 50 minutes in class during Period 5 of Wednesday.

I'll be honest this is the first time I'm a bit unsure of where the line is drawn between these two. The revision checklist is there but I'm pretty sure resonance is only for the validation. The experiment itself was also interference phenomena, such as sound waves inside of closed pipes and finding resonant lengths for certain frequencies, but that's in the revision checklist as well. Of course, (in Dr Water's class) we did standing waves and some interference phenomena involving nodal lines and such, but that was it in terms of the topic test.

## Topic Test - Waves

Waves will be the focus of the test. The objectives for this topic test in the form of a checklist is on Connect and can be found on [this](https://connect.det.wa.edu.au/group/students/ui/class/announcements?coisp=DomainSchoolClass:4553390992&viewNotice=4805238415#349638_2 "Waves Topic Test & Resonance Experiment Validation") notice. The general topics are explained below.

### Summary
1. Waves and Classifications
2. Graphing Waves/Analysis of waves
3. Wave equations and anatomy
4. Reflection and Refraction
5. Standing Waves
6. Interference phenomena

### Waves and Classifications

A **wave** is a **disturbance with periodic oscillations that transfers energy from its origin to another point**. When waves move through space, **they can displace particles**, however, **the net displacement of these particles is 0**/**there is no net transfer of matter**. There are a few misconceptions about this, so **take note of the *common misconceptions* below**:
1. There is no matter displaced: X --> Matter is displaced, but particles will return to their original position *ceteris paribus* (haha econoemik *gags* moment, this kind of answer really isn't needed unless a question presses for it, otherwise just say what is above)
2. No matter cannot be net displaced by the energy a wave transfers: X --> Take for example a surfer surfing on a wave on the ocean (an actual wave!). Only the particles in the medium (water) that the wave is travelling in experiences no net displacement, however, the surfer is most definitely displaced (I mean that's *surfing*... unless you don't know what surfing is, in that case, have a bit of time outside on God's green Earth (I'm not Christian or Christian))

Waves can be classified into four different categories based on their properties, which are **transverse, longitudinal, mechanical and non-mechanical**. Transverse waves **oscillate, and hence, displace matter perpendicularly to their own direction/propagation**. Longitudinal waves, on the other hand, **displaces matter in the same direction that they move**, that is, **the direction of the displacement of particles is parallel to the direction of the wave's propagation**. Mechanical waves **require a medium** (usually a substance constituting of some type of matter) **to travel**, while non-mechanical waves **do not require a medium to travel** (but can still travel through most media (plural of medium, keep in mind, but haha how's it going in the news guys maybe news is a type of wave who knows)). Below is a cross-table with some examples of these types of waves.

| ----------- | Transverse | Longitudinal |
| Mechanical | Water/ocean wave | Sound |
| Non-mechanical | Electromagnetic radiation | Electromagnetic radiation [^1] |
