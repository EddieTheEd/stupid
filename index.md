Jello! I make some funny notes for things I find interesting or just for reference. Ignore the link below, only my joy for finally having a website.

[waw](screw_right_wings.md)

I make notes on mostly science (physics & chem, anything else is terrible) or literature. 

Physics Notes:
- [i need help](physics_notes.md)

Chemistry Notes:
- Work in progress! (I mostly write my notes for chemistry)

Literature Notes:
- [rantsolve of Jekyll and Hyde?](I_hate_psychoanalysis_but_that_and_Jekyll_and_Hyde.md)
