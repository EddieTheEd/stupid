Jello! I make some funny notes for things I find interesting or just for reference. Ignore the link below, only my joy for finally having a website.

[waw](screw_right_wings.md)

I make notes on mostly science (physics & chem, anything else is terrible), literature and also Japanese (usually summaries). 

Physics Notes:
- [i need help (first physics CAP notes)](Physics/Linear%20Motion%20Notes.md)
- [yum (Waves investigation)](Physics/Waves%20Evaluation%20and%20Analysis%20Task%20Research.md)
- [tastier (Waves Topic Test and Resonance Validation Test)]()

Chemistry Notes:
- Work in progress! (I mostly write my notes for chemistry)

Literature Notes:

- [rantsolve of Jekyll and Hyde?](Literature/I_hate_psychoanalysis_but_that_and_Jekyll_and_Hyde.md)

This should be an $x$ that is inline

$$ this is a block$$

Japanese Notes:
- [Test on 4th! mmmMMEWINERGMFINWIEFS](Japanese/Writing_test_summary.md)
